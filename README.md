## About Me
<h3>Hi, I'm Max!</h3> I'm currently working through The Odin Project to learn full-stack web development while pursuing a bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems (MIS). As someone who's passionate about technology, I'm honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more, with plans to dive deeper into back-end development and cloud computing. Alongside my university studies, I'm actively progressing through The Odin Project, focusing on the Ruby on Rails path. This hands-on experience is allowing me to gain practical knowledge of web development, while continuing to explore the intersection of technology and business. I'm excited to keep expanding my skills and knowledge in the tech field, and I'm looking forward to building a career where I can contribute to innovative and impactful projects.
Feel free to check out my projects!<br>
